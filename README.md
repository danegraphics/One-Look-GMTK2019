# One Look
A small game I made in about 24 hours for the GTMK 2019 game jam!

You're a small cube of green goo that needs to get the key and get to the end, however, you only get a single glance at the room before you have to navigate it.

## Design
Everything was hand written and designed completely from scratch. 

This even includes the game engine that manages sprite animations, camera controls, parallax graphics, hitboxes, etc.

Because my IRL health was limited, I couldn't work for the whole 48 hours, but I'm happy with what I was able to get done in the time I had.
